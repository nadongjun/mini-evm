# mini-evm

This project is an implementation of a mini Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) in Golang. The implementation follows the guide available at [Building an EVM from scratch - Part 1: The Execution Context](https://karmacoma.notion.site/Building-an-EVM-from-scratch-part-1-the-execution-context-c28ebb4200c94f6fb75948a5feffc686).

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to build a simple EVM from scratch, taking inspiration and guidance from the provided guide. The project is structured to cover various aspects of EVM, including the execution context, opcodes, and basic functionality. This project assumes a foundational understanding of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and aims to provide hands-on experience in implementing its core components.
